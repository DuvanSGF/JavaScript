	<!--Arrays store multiple values in a single varible.

		To store three course names, you need three variables:
		
		var course1 = "HTML";
		var course2 = "CSS";
		var course3 = "JS";

		but what if you had 500 courses? the solution is an array:

		var courses = new Array("HTML","CSS","JS");


		note:

		this syntax declares an array named courses,
		 which stores thre value, or elements.
