	JAVA script variables are containers for data values. Objects are variables too, 
	but they can contain many values.

	Think of an object as a list of values that are written as name:value pairs, with the names and the values separated by colons.
	
	Note: JavaScript objects are containers for named values.

	Example:
-->
	
	<script type="text/javascript">
		
			var person={
				name:"Angela", age:21,
				favColor:"pink", height:183
			};


	</script>
