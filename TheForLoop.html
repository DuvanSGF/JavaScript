			Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. They are handy in cases wich you want to run
			the same code repeatedly, adding a different value each time.

			JavaScript has three types of loops: for while and do while.

			The for loops is commonly used when creating a loop.


			Sintax:

					for(statement 1; statement2;
						statement 3){
							code block to be executed
						}

			.........................................

			Statement 1: is executed before the loop (the code block) starts.
			Statement 2: defines the condition for running the loop(the code block)
			statement 3: is executed each time after the loop (the code block) has been executed.

			as you can see, the classic for loop has three components, or statement
	
			Example nÂ° 1
		var i =1;	
				for (; i <=5; i++) {
				document.write(i+"<br/>");
			}	
			

				for (i = 1, text=""; i<=5; i++) {
		text = i;
		document.write(i+"<br/>");
	}
	-->

	<script type="text/javascript">
			
		for (i = 1; i <=5; i++) {
			document.write(i+"<br/>");
		}

	</script>
