		JavaScrip's concat() method allows you to join arrays and create an entirely
		new array.

		Example:

		var c1 = ["HTML","CSS"];
		var c2 = ["JS","C++"];
		var course = c1.concat(c2);

		the courses array that result contains 4 elements (HTML,CSS,JS,C++).

		The concat operation does not affect the c1 and c2 arrays -it returns the resulting
		concatenation as a new array.
